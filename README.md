# Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, I made a Neural network model that uses TF-IDF tranformation technique to classify a user review

In the end, the accuracy is 87.82 percent. However, after increasing my training data set size, I got an accuracy rate of 90 percent. I lost the version with a 90 percent accuracy rate by accidentally deleting it thinking that it was the version with 87.82 percent.
